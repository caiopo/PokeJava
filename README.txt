Welcome to PokeJava, an Java Wrapepr for Pokeapi!

Current version: 0.1

As of now, there is no formal documentation to explain the basics of this project. There are plans to add a documentation for this wrapper in the future.
For now this README will be used to track progress.

0.1 - Abstract ModelClass added that handles extracting the API and using JSON to parse code.
	Pokemon class has basic functionality and all necessary properties. Looking to delve deeper into the class once basic functionality works in all other major API
	objects. This includes adding types, pokemon relationships, moves, etc.
	Active TODO: Add:
		Abilities class
		Egg Groups class
		Pokemon:
			Evolution relationships
			Male/Female ratio
		Moves class
		Types
		
	
	TODO for 0.2: Add types, pokemon relationships classes, finish Pokemon class

0.2 - Changed JSON parser from quick-json to org.json. Added evolution hierarchy.
